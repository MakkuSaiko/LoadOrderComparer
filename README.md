# LoadOrderComparer
Skyrim Modding tool for comparing two load orders (Copy and pasted into the app from loot). Useful for matching mods with a friend for Skyrim together

Requires JRE, the latest I guess (https://www.java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp?locale=en).

How to Use:
1. Get load order text from LOOT (Copy to clipboard)
2. Paste into Textfield
3. Enter your load order name
4. Copy friend's load order text (Text file, sent over IM, whatever works)
5. Step 2/3
6. Click Compare
7. Look at output to see differences

Note: 
Will only work for comparing plugins.
Paste the text exactly as receved from LOOT.
